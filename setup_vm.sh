# This script runs on first startup, setting up the VM and installing software for use Doing so reduces the size of the VM image for export purposes.

# When developing a new VM image, the developer should prepare the following:
# * manually install git, cowsay, and lolcat
#   * sudo apt install git cowsay lolcat
# * clone RASBox
#   * cd ~/
#   * git clone https://github.com/ut-ras/RASBox.git
# * on first setup, insert a prompt to trigger setup_vm.sh (on every startup until the setup script has executed successfully)
#   * at the end of ~/.bashrc: cowsay -f tux "Welcome to RASBox! If this is your first time here, check out our RASBox guide. Just enter in the command 'razzle'!" | lolcat
# * insert a prompt to read the RASbox_User_Guide (always on terminal startup)
# Additionally, tell the user to follow the prompts in the command line.

# TODO: check if flag in env variables indicates that setup is complete

echo "This might take a while. The terminal will prompt you to input the password (ReallyAwesomeStudents), and to confirm installing software. Say 'Y' when asked to install software."
